<marquee><h1> Music Information</h1></marquee>
<h2>Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice.<br>
 A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist
 (in jazz and<br>/or popular music).
 Singers perform music (arias, recitatives,<br> songs, etc.) 
that can be sung with or without accompaniment<br> by musical instruments. </h2>

<p> Singing Concept :<br>
Music is patterns of melody, rhythm, harmony, tempo/dynamics, and timbre combined to create repetition, variation and contrast.

<h10> History Of Music</h10> : <br>The history of music covers the historical development and presence 
of music from prehistoric times to <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/HaydnPlaying.jpg"

 the present day. Though definitions
 of music vary wildly throughout the world, every known culture partakes in it, and music is thus
 considered a cultural universal. <br>
 *Who first invented music? 

They usually put forward several answers, including crediting a character from the Book of Genesis named Jubal, who was said to have played the flute, or Amphion, a son of Zeus,
 who was given the lyre. One popular story from the Middle Ages credits the Greek philosopher Pythagoras as the inventor of music.<br>
Music history, sometimes called historical musicology, is a highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of musicology that studies music from a historical point of view. In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of Indian music or the history of rock). In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of ethnomusicology or cultural studies, whether or not they are ethnographically based. The terms "music history" and "historical musicology" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called "art music" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).

The methods of music history include source studies (esp. manuscript studies), paleography, philology (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical method), musical analysis, and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of music theory. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include peer-reviewed articles in journals, university press-published music history books, university textbooks, new editions of musical works, biographies of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between words and music, and reflections upon the role of music in society.</li>
